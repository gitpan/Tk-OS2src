Most patches in this directory are preserved only to simplify merge
with Illya Vaes (possible) improvements to his port.  Even patches
related to the latest release may be already applied if they fix
the OS2-related files from this distribution.

Apply only those patches which relate to the current distribution (see
below) and only if it is marked as not applied yet.

With 800.012 you will need diff_Tk800.012_newer only.
