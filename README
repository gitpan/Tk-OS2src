The only target of this distribution is to deliver the additional files
needed for non-X Tk on OS/2 via CPAN.pm.

Note that tkOS2GC.c is not included in Illya Vaes's tk-os2 distribution 
any more.

The Illya's port includes also files

default.h		- modified patch
tkCanvPs.c		- included as patch
tkImgPhoto.c		- not needed
tkMain.c		- not needed
tkOption.c
tkPort.h		- not needed
tkSend.c		- modified patch
tkWindow.c		- modified patch

I do not know what is the tkOption.c fix for, the rest is handled by patching.

CHANGES:
1.02:	Started the Tk800 port (a lot of rough edges with menubars, menus,
	coords. of balloons).  
	(Only residual support of new features of Tk800.)
	One needs to manually disable build of InputO.
