VERSION 1.04 works only with "newer" Tk (tested with 800.023 only).
Use older versions for older Tk.  A lot of manual intervention is still
needed.  See INSTALL.

The only target of this distribution is to deliver the additional files
needed for non-X Tk on OS/2 via CPAN.pm.

Note that tkOS2GC.c is not included in Illya Vaes's tk-os2 distribution 
any more.

The Illya's port includes also files

default.h		- modified patch
tkCanvPs.c		- included as patch
tkImgPhoto.c		- not needed
tkMain.c		- not needed
tkOption.c
tkPort.h		- not needed
tkSend.c		- modified patch
tkWindow.c		- modified patch

I do not know what is the tkOption.c fix for, the rest is handled by patching.

CHANGES:
1.02:	Started the Tk800 port (a lot of rough edges with menubars, menus,
	coords. of balloons).  
	(Only residual support of new features of Tk800.)
	One needs to manually disable build of InputO.

1.03:	Make addres.cmd pick up a correct DLL (names differ now for different 
	perls.)
	Do not show switch-entry for withdrawn-from-the-start windows.
	Let PM walk new windows.
	Make transient windows have close buttons.
	Root coordinates calculated OK now (menus posted in a correct place).
	Menu accelerators work.
	Fileevents work again.
	"Real" menubars are height-resized, and post menus in a right
	position.
  Bugs:
	  menus can work even if one releases the button before choosing 
		the menu item - just put ! in Menubutton.pm:271.)
	  but with this basic_demo shows problems with popdown selection boxes.
	  Even without this a combobox is posted below the window.
	  "Real" menubars post menus with bad sensitivity, like comboboxes.
	  $Foo->Icon() hangs
1.04:
	Support new font selection API.
	Rework the logic of font selection.
	Rework the calculation of a rendered text string length.  Now the
	characters "flow" at most by one pixel when the insertion point moves.
	[This looks hardly avoidable.  Fonts are rendered usings units of 1/256
	 of a pixel.  If A is 6.3 pixels wide, then the chars in AAA are placed
	 at x-offsets of 0, 6, 13 - I assume usual rounding, I do not know which
	 rounding algo is actually used.  If the insertion point is put after the
	 first A, then AAA is rendered as A - of width 6, then AA at offset 6.
	 When AA is rendered at offset 6, the chars are put at offsets 6 and 12.
	 Thus moving the insertion point by one char moves the third A from offset
	 13 to offset 12.]
	Use inter-module communication to reset the event-loop-handler of Tk::Event
	when Tk creates a first window.
