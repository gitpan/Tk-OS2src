The only target of this distribution is to deliver the additional files
needed for non-X Tk on OS/2 via CPAN.pm.

Note that tkOS2GC.c is not included in Illya Vaes's tk-os2 distribution 
any more.

The Illya's port includes also files

default.h		- modified patch
tkCanvPs.c		- included as patch
tkImgPhoto.c		- not needed
tkMain.c		- not needed
tkOption.c
tkPort.h		- not needed
tkSend.c		- modified patch
tkWindow.c		- modified patch

I do not know what is the tkOption.c fix for, the rest is handled by patching.
